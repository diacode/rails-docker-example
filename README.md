# Rails Docker Example

Source code for our step by step [tutorial on how to deploy a Rails app to production and staging with Docker and Docker Compose](deploying-a-rails-app-to-production-with-docker-pt-1#creating-a-docker-image-for-our-rails-project).

The base Rails app is the [Action Cable example by DHH](https://github.com/rails/actioncable-examples).

## Live comments example

1. Open two browsers with separate cookie spaces (like a regular session and an incognito session). 
2. Login as different people in each browser. 
3. Go to the same message.
4. Add comments in either browser and see them appear real-time on the counterpart screen.
